        <h3>Horton Hears a Boom</h3>
        <p>We all know the classic Dr. Sues story, but <span class="blue-text">what if Horton was an office worker
            and the mysterious noise was a bomb?</span> See the chaos that ensues while Horton and his boss
            try to deal with this outrageous situation. Will Horton’s keen ears help save the day? This
            video was the final production of my intro to electronic media production class. For the
            production I was the screenwriter and director.</p>

            in front of him.</span> Your only clue to what is going on are the sounds of the event. This video was
            created for my moving images class and was an exercise in audio mixing and using sound to help
            tell the story.</p>

        <p>Nothing is better on a rainy day than a burrito. And there is only one way to get there.
           Four wheels mounted to a piece of wood. However, as the saying goes <span class="blue-text">the journey is more important
           than the destination.</span> Even if the destination involves a tortilla filled with meat and cheese.
           Come take a tour through familiar locations in Minneapolis and the Twin-Cities campus in the rain.</p>
